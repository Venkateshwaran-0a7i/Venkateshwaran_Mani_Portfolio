# 🚀 Venkateshwaran Mani — Professional Portfolio

This repository contains my **personal portfolio website**, built to showcase my technical skills, projects, and engineering mindset.  
The focus is on **clarity, structure, and real-world implementation**, not gimmicks or over-engineering.

This portfolio is intended for **recruiters, hiring managers, and technical reviewers**.
